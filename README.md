**Pussy Bot**, a.k.a [@pussy_bot](https://twitter.com/pussy_bot), is a Victorian Cat-themed bot. It tweets snippets from the 1895 book *Pussy and Her Language*, by Marvin R. Clark, accompanied by mid-to-late 19th century and early 20th century fine artworks featuring cats.

These Python 2.7 scripts power [@pussy_bot](https://twitter.com/pussy_bot), and use a couple libraries to help parse text and gather images from the web. Twython provides a painless layer between Python and the Twitter API. The scripts are currently running as a cron job on PythonAnywhere's cloud.
